#Airline Flight Management System

#Airlines face significant challenges in efficiently managing their flight operations,
including scheduling, crew assignments, route management, and airport services. To
address these challenges, this project focuses on developing an Airline Flight
Management System as a third-party solution. The system provides an integrated
admin panel where airline administrators can manage flights, routes, crew assignments,
airport security, airport maintenance, and medical support for multiple airlines and airports.
